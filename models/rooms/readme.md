### Create Rooms
Hoffmation is centered about rooms. 
Many follow certain default behaviour while others have very specific rules.
To be modular Rooms within HoffMation should be generated automatically.

To do so use the Excel Document `Raumdefinition.xlsm`
Within that document you have to create all your rooms and the devices.

Afterwards you can create the resulting config code and paste that into 
`server/config/roomConfig.txt`
